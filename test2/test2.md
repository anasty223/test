Please create a banner (frame) with the size of 300x250px.
Animate inside the banner a black ball with the diameter of 50px. 
The ball will be falling from top (initially not visible) to the bottom and bounces for a couple of times (you decide how many times) until it stops bouncing.
Try to make the bould bouncing as natural as possible.

In this folder you can find a storyboard.
